#### Shortcodes

For now Craftsman WordPres theme comes with small number of shortcodes to used to create bootstrap grid. We plan to increase this number significantly in future version of themes.![](/assets/94.png)

Let's go over them.

1. _**Row** - user this shortcode to wrap columns_
2. _**Column** - use this shortcode to create columns inside one row. Possible values are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. Sum of these number inside one row should be 12._
