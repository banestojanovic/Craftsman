**Using Craftory theme as full craftsmen listing and job board system**

Using Craftory theme as full job board system means that your users will be able to create their accounts while choosing role as either "craftsman" or "client".

_To find more about user roles go to this section: _[_User Roles_](/users/user-roles.md)

One of the main things by using the theme in this way is ability for users, depending whether they are of craftsman or client role, to **post jobs, create their profiles with a lot of options, apply or invite to jobs, managing jobs and job applicants** \( craftsmen that applied to an job \),** review system with ratings and testimonials, searching for both jobs and craftsmen and a lot more.**

**Using Craftsman theme as craftsmen listing only**

Using Craftory theme as listing of craftsmen will remove all functionality connected to jobs from the theme, which means that only things relevant to Craftsmen will be left. We strongly suggest this option if your intention when buying the theme was to have listing of people \( craftsmen \) and more like affiliate website.

If you needed theme which will allow your site visitors to effectively perform search, that would be great for SEO and affiliate marketing, then this is the option for you.
