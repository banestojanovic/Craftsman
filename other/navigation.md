#### Navigation

Navigation in WordPress themes can be set by going to _appearance -&gt; menus_.

By default in the theme navigation submenu is displayed in two columns, but you can set it to single column by going to parent element and adding class "_column-single_".![](/assets/navigation_column.png)

**I don't have field to add css class to navigation, what to do?**

This can happen on new WordPress installations. On the top right of the screen click on the button _Screen Options_, and then enable adding css classes.![](/assets/navigation_css.png)
