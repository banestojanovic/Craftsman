#### Textual Listing Installation

**Difference between Full Theme Installation and Listing Installation**

Listing installation is different only because of the different plugins that are installed. Full theme installation have few more required plugins. Everything else is completely the same.

**What plugins I should install when prompted**

This is more of a question of what plugins you shouldn't install when prompted. From the prompt you shouldn't install below plugins.

1. _PBS\_Craftsman\_Job\_Agent_ - deactivate
2. _PBS\_Craftsman\_Reviews_ - deactivate

If you want to have reviews system for Craftsman Listing only you can have it by installing _PBS\_Craftsman\_Testimonials_ plugin.
