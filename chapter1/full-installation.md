#### Full Theme Installation

**What full theme installation is?**

Full theme installation means that you will install the theme as full job and job agents system, where will be possible for users to post and manage jobs on which craftsmen will be able to apply to, along with membership and review system between them.

If you only wanted theme to be listing of craftsman, without option for jobs posting then please take a look at this installation guide: [Craftory Listing Installation](/chapter1/craftsman-listing-installation.md)

In this part of installation section you will be able to find out how to install theme in fully, to make it look exactly like on our demo. Clicking on one below link will take you to either textual or video tutorial:
