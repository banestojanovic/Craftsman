Let's explain what you see on the image:

_01_\_Craftsman\_Theme - \_In this folder you will find theme that you will use to install Craftsman theme on WordPress site.

02\_Craftsman\_Child\_Theme - In this folder you will find child theme that you can use to make customization to existing theme without worrying that your changes will be affected by some future update.

03\_Craftsman\_Changelog - In this folder you will find changelog.txt file where you can track all theme changes and find the list of files that were affected.

04\_Craftsman\_Help - In this folder you will find help file \( theme documentation \) that you can use as guide while working with Craftsman WordPress theme. Any issue or question you might have we strongly suggest that your first step in resolving it starts with documentation.

_05\_Craftsman\_PSD - _ In this folder you will find Photoshop Design of the theme.

Next thing that you have to do is to upload the theme to your WordPress site and activate it there. There are two ways to do it. Through WordPress admin dashboard that is common way to do it and directly through server. We will explain how to do it using WordPress uploader.

**Installing Required Plugins**

When you activate the theme you will be prompted to install required plugins. Required plugins are necessary for proper working of the theme.

There are two types of required plugins for this theme.

1. _Required Plugins_ - These are the plugins that are needed for theme to work properly. If any of this plugins is not activated then the theme will not work properly.
2. _Recommended Plugins_ - These plugins are not absolutely necessary for theme to work properly but they will extend functionality of the theme for the better.

Below is the screenshot that will show you how required plugins prompt will be displayed to you:
