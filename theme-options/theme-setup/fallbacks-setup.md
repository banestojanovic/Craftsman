#### Fallbacks Setup

Fallback options are options that are used in places where user can dynamically add their own but hasn't done it yet. When that happens options from here will be used instead.![](/assets/72.png)

Let's go over option:

1. _Pages Header Image - This image will be used where you haven't set image header on that page_
2. _Header Image - This image is used on single pages where user hasn't set it_
3. _Header Title - Header title fallback used on single page headers if registered user had not set it manually._
4. _Header Subtitle - Header subtitle fallback used on single page headers if registered user had not set it manually._
5. _Get Quote Text - Get quote text that is displayed on craftsman single page_
