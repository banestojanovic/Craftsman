Afterwards, Google team will review your website and decide if they are going to allow you to post ads on your site \( Craftsman theme \) and start making passive income.

**I've got some code from Google AdSense, what to do with it?**

On Google AdSense website, when your site has been approved, you'll get the code for the ads that needs to be entered in the code somewhere and looks like this:

```
<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- Homepage Leaderboard -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
style="display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px"
data-ad-client="ca-pub-1234567890123456"
data-ad-slot="1234567890"></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
```

This kind of code to be fully functional needs to be entered on specific places in the theme. Without help of some third party plugin or coding knowledge users usually finds it hard to do it themselves, even more so to make it reach its full potential.

That's exactly why we provided options for ads to show up on really specific places where it would be very hard for casual users to do it themselves and where third party plugins couldn't reach without breaking the theme and user experiences.

With Craftsman theme it becomes really simple thing to do. Navigate to theme options and paste previously obtained code to textarea. Once you do that, your job is finished and the theme will automatically take care of the rest.

There is more places reserved for Google Ads, above images are just examples. After we gather users impressions and feedback we'll make sure to make necessary updates and corrections in order to provide best possible platform for our customers to make passive income.

**Why Would I Use Google AdSense?**

Let's say for example that you are just done creating your website. It looks and functions just as you want and you have decided to go public with it even if you don't have database of craftsmen and jobs large enough. You'll hardly be able to start earning from active ways of income immediately due to small amount of registered people.

That's when Google AdSense comes as the great way of making some buck by making your site open for advertising other stuff and earning money from it without bothering with the code or overthinking what would be the best place in your site for other ads.
