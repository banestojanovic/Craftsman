#### Role Client

When user has assigned role client to their account that means that they will be able to post jobs on which craftsmen will be able to apply. Assuming that you have created user, from now on you will be able to create Job Posts where you can set newly created user as their author.

If this is done by user him/herself then he/she will automatically set as job post author.

**I did everything as explained but Job Post is still not showing on search page or single page?**

If this happens to you than most likely the case is that user account has been expired or account is not active. Solution is to go to  _Users -&gt; All Users -&gt; USER _ and set _User Status to Active and User Premium Status to Active or Free Trial._

_**User Status = **Active_

**User Premium Status = **_Free Trial / Premium_
