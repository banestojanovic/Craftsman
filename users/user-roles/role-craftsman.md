#### Role Craftsman

When an user has craftsman role assign to their account they become available to become author of Craftsman post type. Without connecting them with one Craftsman post they will not be able to manage their profile and become visible to job posters \( clients \) and other users. This is only the case if you create craftsman from WordPress Administration, because if user creates its account using registration form it will be automatically done for them.

The next step when you create user with craftsman role is to go to _Craftsmen -&gt; Add New _section from wp admin dashboard and publish new Craftsman post. While creating post make sure that you select author of Craftsman post. Author of post should be user that has craftsman role assign to it.

If this happens to you than most likely the case is that user account has been expired or account is not active. Solution is to go to  _Users -&gt; All Users -&gt; USER _ and set _User Status to Active and User Premium Status to Active or Free Trial._

**User Premium Status = **_Free Trial / Premium_
