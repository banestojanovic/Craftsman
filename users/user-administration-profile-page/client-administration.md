#### Client Administration

Client administration is reserved for registered users that have set their account to role _Client_.

Their profile page consists of few parts:

1. **Dashboard**
2. **Profile Settings / \( **_User Settings in wp admin area \)_
3. **Jobs**

There are two ways to keep track of this things that are dependable if you are logged in to site as _Client_ user or _Administrator_.

If you are logged in to site as _Client_ you will be able to access profile page and manage account directly from frontend. On the other hand if you are logged in as _Administrator_ you would only be able to manage those things through WordPress Admin dashboard.
