_Craftsmen_ are users that are applying to jobs that were posted by _Clients_. When an _Client_ posts a job or when _Craftsman_ creates its profile it will be displayed at various places on the site, most notably on search page. _Craftsmen_ then will be able to apply on jobs, be invited to work on jobs by _Clients_ and both of them will be able to give reviews and ratings for each job to each other.
