#### Job Applications

Job Applications are connection between _Craftsmen & Clients_. When an craftsman applies to work on the job _Job Application_ is directly created.

If user has role _Client_ he/she then can access all applications for one job and decide what to do, while if user has role _Craftsman_ he/she can get overview of all jobs that he/she applied to and status of those applications.

**Application Statuses**

There are four possible applications statuses, those are: _Inactive, Rejected, Progress, Finished._

1. _Inactive -_ This means that an application for job is received but it is still not responded e.g. the client has not yet decided which craftsmen application to accept.
2. _Rejected -_ This means that an application for job is rejected and that craftsman will not be able to apply to work on that job anymore.
3. _Progress _- This means that an application for job is accepted and that job is considered as work in progress._ _When _Client_ accepts an applications all others are automatically rejected.
4. _Finished -_ This means that an applications has been marked by finished by _Client_ and the job is considered as done. After this both _Craftsman_ that has worked on the job and _Client_ are available to give review to each other for the job done. Application can be marked as finished only if it had status progress beforehand.
