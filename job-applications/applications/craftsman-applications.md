When you follow that path you'll find yourself on Job Applications page where you can see statuses of your all applications.![](/assets/34.png)If application status is set to _Inactive_ or in _Progress_ you'll be able to contact _Client_ that has posted the job.



When your job application is marked as _Progress_ that means that your application has been accepted and that you are considered to wok on the job.

When the job is ended your applications will be marked as _Finished_ by client and you'll be able to access it by clicking on _Finished Jobs_ in sidebar navigation.![](/assets/35.png)Now you'll be able to give review to client by going to his profile page.
